## Task A: Connecting with the team
On November 30th, the team's repository was created and shared with all group members. An email was sent introducing the project, outlining the various roles available, and requesting each member's preferences based on their comfort level and experience. The email also invited suggestions for diseases to study. Email collaboration and discussion continued from November 30th until December 2nd as the team decided on the disease of interest and assigned roles. To better facilitate communication, an iMessage group chat was created.

## Task B: Selecting a disease to study

## Task C: Find a gene underlying the disease

## Task D: Build a protein:protein interaction (PPI) network using the known gene protein product(s) as seeds

## Task E: Find tissue-specific eQTLs DNA polymorphisms that could alter the expression of the candidate genes

## Task F: Construct an hypothesis that the genes caused the disease phenotype by mechanism X
